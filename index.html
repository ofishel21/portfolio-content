<p>This is a quick preview of what I look like, but do not fear, there is a lot more where that came from. Ive also included an amzing picture of The Big House here at University of Michigan. I took this picture while at the maize out game against Washington on September 11th. The halftime show was incredible, with moving tirbutes to those who sacrificed themselves to protect our country and constitution on that day. I included this picture as a reminder of how precious the little things in life are. As a student here at U of M, I am eternally grateful for the oppurtunity I've been given, and want to share my experiences from before and throughout college here on my webpage. So please, dive right in!</p>
